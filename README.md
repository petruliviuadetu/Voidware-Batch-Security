# Voidware-Batch-Security
Voidware is a program that sets security to your batch program, stopping it from getting exploited (note: Big exploits will get patched later)


We offer a whitelist system for your program if the program gets exploited.

We do not offer a auto protection or just whitelist, we offer them both!

About us: We are a free service. We are like cloudflare but free and program-sided not website-sided


Make a issue if you are banned from the voidware protection.

Program languges we support: Batch
